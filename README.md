# Firebase database

A cloud-hosted NoSQL database. Data is stored as JSON(JavaScript Object Notation), synced across connected devices in milliseconds, and available when your app goes offline. Intuitive and easy-to-use API. Remains responsive regardless of network latency or Internet connectivity so your Firebase app works offline.

 Real-time data is the way of the future. Most databases require you to make HTTP calls to get and sync your data. Most databases give you data only when you ask for it. When you connect your app to Firebase, you’re not connecting through normal HTTP. You’re connecting through a Web Socket.

# Vuex

Vuex is a state management pattern + library for Vue.js applications. It serves as a centralized store for all the components in an application, with rules ensuring that the state can only be mutated in a predictable fashion. It also integrates with Vues official devtools extension to provide advanced features such as zero-config time-travel debugging and state snapshot export / import.
